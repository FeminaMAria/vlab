### INTRODUCTION<br>
#### In order to overcome the problem existing in the potentiometers, the synchros are used. These are the electromagnetic rotary transducer which can convert the angular displacement of objects into an electrical signal. The electrical signal can be an alternating signal. The Vice versa process is also possible.In control systems the synchros are used as error detectors and as encoders under different commercial names. The trade names are Selsyn,Autosyn,Telesyn. Selsyn means Self-Synchronous.
#### The synchros consists of synchro trnmitter an synchro control transformer. These two components are interconnected to form the synchro pair.
#### The synchro transmitter is similar to three phase alternator and it has a stationary stator and a rotor.The synchro control transformer is similar to the transmitter except the shape of the rotor is cylindrical.The rotor in transmitter is dumb bell shaped.synchro tris used as error detector and as encoder.

### CONCEPT<br>
#### The Input to the Transmitter is AC signal and it is applied across the rotor coils. The input to the synchro control transformer is the emf generated by the transmitter, which is applied across the stator coils.
####  The ouput obtained in the transmitter is the emf across the stator coils and in the control transormer it is the voltage across the rotor coils which makes it to rotate. 
#### The error detection is the main function of synchros.The transmitter and receiver at different locations helps to identify the error.
#### To find the percentage errorr the angular displacement is set in the transmitter and the corresponding variation is noted in the receiver after connecting the transmitter and receivers windings.
#### Based on the error detected, the final control element in the system will take a decision so that the error is reduced to a minimum value.
#### To understand the concept, the synchro pair is connected and the transmitter is set at various angles and the receiver angular displacement is tabulated.
