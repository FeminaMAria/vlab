## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Synchro transmitter-receiver characteristics

### 1. Story Outline:

The experimental set-up involves the circuit connection of synchro transmitter–receiver pair. The objective of the experiment is to observe the angular displacement in the receiver for the set angle in the transmitter. The data tabulated, is used to find the % error and to plot the set angle vs. measured angle graph and % error curve. The difference in the angular positions is found out and corrections can be done.

### 2. Story:
The application of synchro- pair is error detection and acts as a position transducer for aircraft control surfaces. As a position transducer it helps in detection of the exact location of the objects.


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Construction set-up
For visualization, the description is as follows:
Let us assume that the user lands up into the simulator page where the synchro transmitter -receiver is shown to start the simulation. The user will do the experiment as per the detailed procedure. The user will click connections and the simulator automatically connects the three windings of transmitter and receiver. The circuit connections are tested and will click the TEST connections to check whether the connections are correct or not. After successful completion of circuit connection, user will set angle in the transmitter side at 15 degrees and can observe that the receiver side will automatically move to the same set angle. The procedure is repeated in steps of 15 degrees till 360 degrees and tabulated. Then the graphs are plotted automatically. 
	
  Percentage error is calculated using the expression = ((Өs- Өm)/Өs)  *100<br>
  Where Өs is the set angle in the transmitter side<br>
	     Өm is the measured angle in the receiver side<br>

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

1. The primary objective of the experiment is to find the angular displacement of the receiver.
2. To infer how the receiver responds to the variation in angle on the transmitter side for various angles.
3. To find the percentage error that indicates the variation in angular position on the receiver side with respect to the transmitter.
4. Plot the graph for Set angle (x-axis) versus measured angle (y-axis)
5. Plot the percentage error curve for set angle (x- axis) versus percentage error (y-axis)
6. Attempt the assessment questions (Quizzes)  
 



#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1. Initially, the simulator page consisting of aim and apparatus required is displayed with “START” button to start the simulation.
2. Next page allows the user to make connections between transmitter and receiver. User will click “CONNECTIONS” and simulator will immediately make connections between S1 of transmitter and S1 of receiver, S2 of transmitter and S2 of receiver, S3 of transmitter and S3 of receiver side.
3. Once connections are made, press “TEST CONNECTIONS” button to check if the given connections are correct.
4. Press “TURN ON” to switch on the Supply. Enter the value of set angle in Input box and at intervals of 15 degrees at the transmitter side and click “ACCELERATE TRANSMITTER” and observe on the receiver side. 
5. Repeat for angles till 360 degrees by entering the input angle in Input box at intervals of 15 degrees and click “ACCELERATE TRANSMITTER” each time and observe the receiver side.
6. Tabulate all the readings manually and Click “READING” button to view the Observation table. Enter the reading and check the percentage error calculated automatically.
7. Click on the “PLOT GRAPHS” button to get the graph for set angle vs measured angle, set angle Vs percentage error curve.Click on the “PLOT GRAPHS” button to get the graph for set angle vs measured angle, set angle vs percentage error curve.



#### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
 
Q1. The error voltage is proportional to the ............ in the rotor positions of transmitter and the control transformer<br>
a) <b>Difference<br></b>
b) sum<br>
c) Negative<br>
d) None of the above<br>


Q2. The maximum angular position that can be used in Synchro pair is...................<br>
a) 90 degrees<br>
b) 180 degrees<br>
c) <b>360 degrees<br></b>
d) 0 degrees<br>


Q3. When the transmitter angle is at 45 degrees the receiver is expected to be at an angle of ..........<br>
a)<b>45 degrees<br></b>
b) 0 degrees<br>
c) 60 degrees<br>
d) 30 degrees <br>

Q4. The percentage error is always expected to be ........... for perfect positioning of objects<br>
a. High<br>
b. <b>Zero<br></b>
c. Infinite<br>
d. non-Infinite<br>


Q5. Is the secondary winding distributed around the periphery?<br>
a) <b>yes<br></b>
b)   No<br>




#### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
•	Improper connection between S1, S2 and S3 will not move forward in the simulator screen<br>
•	Entering wrong data on the observation table will not generate the graph.<br>



#### 2.6 Conclusion:

Time taken by the user to complete the simulation is 20 mins after going through theory and procedure. <br> Evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user. The moment the student clicks on the answer of his choice, the CORRECT ANSWER should be displayed below the question. <br> This would enable the student to understand whether the user is right or wrong immediately.

#### 2.7 Equations/formulas:
  
1. Formula used for calculating the percentage error in percentage.
  
	Percentage error is calculated using the expression = ((Өs- Өm)/Өs)  *100<br>
	Where	 Өs is the set angle in the transmitter side<br>
		 Өm is the measured angle in the receiver side<br>
