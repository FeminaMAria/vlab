[1. Focus Area](#LO)

[2. Learning Objectives](#LO)

[3. Instructional Strategy](#IS)

[4. Task & Assessment Questions](#AQ)

[5. Simulator Interactions](#SI)

\#### 1. Focus Area: Instrumentation and Practical Skills, Experimentation, Performance evaluation by data analysis.

The students know the instrumentation and concept of synchro transmitter- receiver and the performance at different set angle. They do the experimentation based on the formula.

\#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

Sr. No | Learning Objective | Cognitive Level | Action Verb

\:--|:--|:--|:-:

1.| User will be able to: Describe the components in the diagram. | Remember | Describe.

2.| User will be able to: Demonstrate the performance of synchro pair at different angular positions. | Understand | Demonstrate.

3.| User will be able to: Interpret the set angle in transmitter Vs Measured angle in receiver. | Understand | Interpret.

\#### 3. Instructional Strategy

\###### Name of Instructional Strategy:  Expository

\###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment and Summative Assessment

` `Description:  Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: 

` `The instructional strategy identified is Expository as the students learn in the theory course the concepts of synchro pair, its operating principle, and the performance characteristics. So, the virtual laboratory experiment will help the students to understand practically the characteristics of synchro pair.

The formative assessment (quiz) given before the test will also help the students to evaluate themselves. Later the experiment will be done by the students based on the instructions. Once the experiment is completed by the student quiz will be given to assess themselves with the learnt concepts.

\#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]

Sr. No | Learning Objective | Task to be performed by the student in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task

\:--|:--|:--|:--

1.| Students will be able to describe the components used in experiment | On the simulator screen, student will answer the quiz before doing the experiment.

2.| Students will be able to do the connections by demonstrations | On simulator screen, students will connect and demonstrate.

3.| Students will be able to set the position of the transmitter at a particular angle in degrees and observe on the receiver side. | On simulator screen, student will set the transmitter angle at 15 degrees(say) and observe at the receiver side.

4.| Students will be able to interpret the plot of graph based on the readings obtained on the transmitter side and receiver side. | On simulator screen, students will take the quiz and answer.

\#### 4. Simulator Interactions:

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do? | Purpose of the task

\:--|:--|:--|:--:

1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the experiment screen | To open screen to perform experiment

2.| Student will connect as per the circuit diagram by dragging from S1,S2 and S3 from transmitter side to S1,S2 and S3 of receiver side. | Simulator will make the connections internally. | To make electrical connections.

3.| Student will click the TEST button on the simulator | Simulator will check the connections if it is correct or not | To check for wrong connections.

4.| Student will click RESET button if connections are wrong else Power switch will be ON | Simulator will switch ON the power supply | To start the experiment if Power is switched ON else RECONNECT.

5.| Student will set angle at transmitter side to be at 15 degrees | Simulator will make receiver to move to 15 degrees automatically | To record and store readings

6.| Student will repeat the same till 360 degrees on the transmitter side | Simulator will display the angle in the receiver side | To record and store the readings.

7.| Student will calculate the percentage error, with the help of formula| Simulator will display the calculated percentage error | To find percentage error.

8.| Student will click the PLOT button to find the plot of the set angle and measured angle in receiver and percentage error curve | Simulator displays the plot| The plot is used to find the inference of the experiment
