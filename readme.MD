### 1. Focus Area
Instrumentation and Practical Skills, Experimentation, Performance evaluation by data analysis.
The students know the instrumentation and concept of synchro transmitter- receiver and the performance at different set angle. They do the experiment based on the formula.

### 3. Instructional Strategy
##### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
##### Assessment Method: Formative and Summative Assessments

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 Section will be Aim, Theory, Procedure, Pretest, Simulation, Posttest and References. The instructional strategy identified is Expository as the students learn in the theory course the concepts of synchro pair, its operating principle, and the performance characteristics. So, the virtual laboratory experiment will help the students to understand practically the characteristics of synchro pair.

The formative assessment (quiz) given before the test will also help the students to evaluate themselves. Later the experiment will be done by the students based on the instructions. Once the experiment is completed by the student quiz will be given to assess themselves with the learnt concepts.(Summative assessment).

### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr. No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Students will click ‘START’ and move to the simulator page. Then click ‘CONNECTIONS’ | Simulator will be started, and simulator will make connections | To make electrical connections
2.| Click On the ‘TEST CONNECTIONS’ button  | Simulator will check the connections and displays connections are valid| To test if connections are right
3.| If connections are right students will press ‘TURN ON’ button.  | Circuit is switched ON if connections are correct   | To start the experiment if power is switched ON 
4.| Set the transmitter at an angle say 15 degrees by entering a value 15 in the input box, and pressing ‘ACCELERATE TRANSMITTER’  | Simulator will make the receiver side to move to 15 degrees automatically | To tabulate and keep record of the output
5.| Repeat the above procedure till transmitter reaches 360 degrees at regular intervals of 15 degrees by entering the required angle at the Input box and clicking ‘ACCELERATE TRANSMITTER’ each time | Simulator will make the receiver side to move in proportion with the set angle in the transmitter side.|To tabulate and keep record of the output
6.| Students will click ‘READING’ and enter the values noted in the tabular column page  | Simulator will calculate percentage error for each observed angle automatically | To find the percentage error.
7.| Students will click ‘PLOT GRAPHS’ button to find the plot of set angle in transmitter and measured angle in receiver and also the percentage error curve. | Simulator will plot the curve  | To infer from the plot the characteristics of synchro pair
