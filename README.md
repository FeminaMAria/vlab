## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Torque measurement using Torque sensor

### 1. Story Outline:

The experimental set-up involves the circuit connection of strain gauge sensor which is connected with steel arm and weighing load. Different arm length and weighing loads are connected to strain gauge sensor to measure the torque produced on the steel arm. The objective of the experiment is to observe the torque reading indicated on the sensor and calculate the same using selected arm length and weighing loads. The data generated from indicated and calculated torque used to find the error % and represents the indicated and calculated torque in a graph.

### 2. Story:
A strain gauge (also strain gage) is a simple device that measures strain developed on any structural object. This device was designed by Edward E. Simmons and Arthur C. Ruge in 1938. An insulating flexible backing that supports a metallic foil pattern is the most popular type of strain gauge. A suitable glue, such as cyanoacrylate, is used to connect the gauge to the item. The foil is deformed because of the object's deformation, causing its change in electrical resistance. The number referred to as the gauge factor that relates the resistance change to the strain, which is commonly measured using a Wheatstone bridge.<br>
Apparatus used<br>
1.	Strain gauge sensor kit<br>
2.	Arm lever<br>
3.	Weighing loads<br>

With the above setup, the circuit connections can be made and varying the arm lever length and weighing loads to note the indicated torque. Then calculate the theoretical torque and find error % to plot the graph between indicated versus theoretical torque.<br>


#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Construction set-up
For visualization, the description as follows:
Let us assume that the end user lands up into the simulator page where to start the simulation followed by all the strain gauge sensor components are placed on right side of the screen to give the circuit connections. User drag & drop all the component and proceed click the verify button to check whether the connections established is correct or not. After successful completion of circuit connection, user can study the strain gauge sensor basics and to enthusiast, user can take up the quiz questions in the simulator. After successful completion of quiz questions user can select the different arm length, weighing load and click to submit. Based on the selection, the indicated torque is displayed on the screen based on the responses from strain gauge. Through slider, the arm length and weighing loads can be changed and observed the indicated torque for all the trials and click the values add to table. After all the selections, the table is displayed with indicated torque then user need to calculate the theoretical torque using the formula. Then error % has been displayed by the simulator and then user need to click plot the graph. Now the graph has been plotted for Calculated torque versus indicated torque.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

1. The primary objective of the experiment is to find the torque acting on the steel arm.
2. To infer how the torque sensor responded for the varying arm length and weighing loads
3. To identify the indicated and calculated torque for the given conditions
4. Compare the indicate and calculated torque and find the error %
5. Plot the graph for indicated (x-axis) versus calculated torque (y-axis)
6. Attempt the assessment questions (Quizzes)  



#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1. Initially, the simulator consisting of aim and there is a BLUE coloured button to “start the simulation”
2. Drag & drop the icons on right side to connect the circuit and press Blue coloured “verify” button to check the given connections
3. After successful connection, the quizzes given to pick the answer using radio button and press “submit” button to validate the answers
4. There is a “slider” to move towards right for selecting arm length and mass. Then click on the Blue coloured “submit” button to display the torque indicated. Click on the “Add” button to store the observations for varied arm length and weighing loads
5. Click on “Display table” button to display the table along with the observations on indicated torque. Using formula, calculate the torque theoretically and fill the data.
6. Once the “Result table” is complete, click on the “Plot the graph” button the graph for indicated torque vs calculated torque will be generated.

b) Applied stress<br>
c) Soldering<br>
<b>d) Bonding<br></b>



#### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Yes, pitfalls there in simulator<br>
This pitfall does not mean wrong answer and retrying. It is designed to clear misconceptions or incorrect knowledge.
Improper connection of circuits will not establish the next simulator screen
Entering wrong data on the observation table will not generate the graph


#### 2.6 Conclusion:

Time taken by the user to complete the simulation is 20 mins after going through theory and procedure<br>
Evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user. The moment the student clicks on the answer of his choice, the CORRECT ANSWER should be displayed below the question. This would enable the student to understand whether he is right or wrong there and there itself.
