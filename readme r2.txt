## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Synchro Transmitter-Receiver characteristics

### 1. Story Outline:

The experimental set-up involves the circuit connection of synchro transmitter –receiver pair.
The objective of the experiment is to observe the angular displacement in the receiver for the set angle in the transmitter. 
The data tabulated, is used to find the % error and to plot the set angle vs. measured angle graph and % error curve. 
The application of synchro- pair is error detector and a position transducer for aircraft control surfaces. 
The difference in the angular positions is found out and corrections can be done


### 2. Story:

Let us assume that the user lands up into the simulator page where the synchro transmitter -receiver is shown to start the simulation.
The user will do the experiment as per the detailed procedure. 
The user will click connections and the simulator automatically connects the three windings of transmitter and receiver. 
The circuit connections are tested and will click the TEST connections to check whether the connections are correct or not. After successful completion of circuit connection, user will set angle in the transmitter side at 30 degrees and can observe that the receiver side will automatically move to the same set angle. 
The procedure is repeated in steps of 30 degrees till 360 degrees and tabulated. Then the graphs are plotted automatically
Percentage error is calculated using the expression =  ((Өs- Өm)/ Өs )*100
Where   Өs is the set angle in the transmitter side
	Өm is the measured angle in the receiver side




#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
When the student visits the link of the simulator page, 

•	Student observes "S1,S2,S3 on transmitter and Receiver side.
•	Student will connect S1 to S1,S2 to S2 ,S3 to S3.
•	Student will switch ON the power supply after checking if connections are correct.
•	Student will set an angle at transmitter side and observe in the receiver side.
•	Student will tabulate different readings till 360 degrees and find the percentage error calculated automatically
•	Student  will click Plot to get the graph 


#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1. The primary objective of the experiment is to find the angular displacement of the receiver.
2. To infer how the receiver responds to the variation in angle on the transmitter side for various angles.
3. To find the percentage error that indicates the variation in angular position on the receiver side with respect to the transmitter.
4. Plot the graph for Set angle (x-axis) versus measured angle (y-axis)
5. Plot the percentage error curve for set angle (x- axis) versus percentage error (y-axis)
6. Attempt the assessment questions (Quizzes)  



#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1. Initially, the simulator page consisting of aim and apparatus required is displayed with a BLUE coloured button to “START” the simulation.
2. Next page has step 1 to make connections between transmitter and receiver. User will drag and make connections between S1 of transmitter and S1 of receiver, S2 of transmitter   and S2 of receiver, S3 of transmitter and S3 of receiver side.
3. After successful connection, press Blue coloured “TEST” button to check if the given connections. If connections are correct then switch ON SW1 and SW2.
4. Drag the Transmitter to 15 degrees and observe on the receiver side and tabulate in the observation table. Repeat for angles till 360 degrees by clicking on the “ADD” button to store the observations for various angles. 
5. Click on “Display table” button to display the table with automatically calculated percentage error.
6. Click on the “PLOT” button to get the graph for set angle vs measured angle, set angle Vs percentage error curve


##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
formative assesment questions
As mentioned in Round 1<br>
Difficulty level: Recall<br>

Q 1.Synchro is used to study transmission of


<br><b> a.Position </b>
<br>	b.Moment
<br>    c.mass
<br>    d.force

Difficulty level: Understand<br>

Q.  2.	What is the phase displacement of the three windings of synchros?
<br>a.	90 degrees   
<br>b.  360 degrees  
<br><b> c. 120 degrees</b>
<br>d.  45 degrees

<br>Q.3. Where is the Primary winding connected?
<br> a.	Stator
<br><b> b.Reference voltage</b>
<br>c. Reference voltage and Stator
<br>d. None

Q. 4.	Is the secondary winding distributed around the periphery?

<br><b> a. Yes </b>
<br> b.No

<br>Q. 5.	The two windings are ……………… coupled 

<br><b>Answer: Mutually </b>



##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
•	Improper connection between S1, S2 and S3 will not move forward in the simulator screen
•	Entering wrong data on the observation table will not generate the graph



##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Evaluation of the pre-test and post-test should be given immediately to the user. 
The moment the student clicks on the answer of his choice, the CORRECT ANSWER should be displayed below the question.
This would enable the student to understand whether the user is right or wrong immediately.



##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: 
Formula used for calculating the percentage error in percentage.
•	Percentage error is calculated using the expression =  ((Өs- Өm)/ Өs )*100
	Where	 Өs is the set angle in the transmitter side
		Өm is the measured angle in the receiver side
